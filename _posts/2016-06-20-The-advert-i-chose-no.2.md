I chose the John lewis advert where a girl is on earth and she looked through her telescope at the moon and she see's a lonely pensioner on the moon and she wants to contact him so in the end she sends him a telescope attached to some balloons so they can see each other .

There is a bit of truth or reality in the advert because there is lots of lonely pensioners in the world so that's probably why John lewis are working with age UK but there is also a lot of fantasy because there wouldn't be a man on the moon living there without a spacesuit and also a normal telescope wouldn't be able to see that far into space and then back to earth,the other fantasy thing in the advert was that balloons would definitely not Last long enough to get to the moon but Even if they did they wouldn't land perfectly into the man's out stretched arms.

The advert is very effective for one reason because it tells people about old people being lonely and it is also effective because the advert is sort of heartwarming, but it doesn't tell you anything about john lewis,what the are,what they do or what they sell.but it would be good for the majority of people because most people know them.But the advert is emotional and it does stick in your head.
